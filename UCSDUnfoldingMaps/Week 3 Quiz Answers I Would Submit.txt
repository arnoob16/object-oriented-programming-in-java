This is perhaps closely related to "drawing the key".  Laying out the positions of the text and dots in the key was a repetitive pain.  It wasn't hard using the hints along with the docs on text(), etc. to get the content to appear.  Figuring out how to make it look nice took as long as the rest of the assignment!

By the way, I got rid of the grey blobs in the map with marker.setStrokeColor() to use the same color as marker.setColor().  The grey blobs happen because of an earthquake swarm where all the marker borders blot out underlying markers.  

That also let me use stroke() in the key to prevent black borders from appearing on the circles.

2 hours (1 to futz with the key layout and 1 to do everything else, including getting circles on the key and drawing text in the key)
